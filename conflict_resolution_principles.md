# Conflict Resolution Principles


Conflict resolution process within the progressive community should adhere to these principles

# Finding of Facts
Complaints shall be made based on the facts. The focus shall be on the facts regarding what actions were taken and what statements were made.
Scrutiny will be applied to disambiguate and set aside opinion, characterizations, assumptions, and speculation.

# First-hand Accounts Take Priority
Heresay, gossip, and other non-first hand accounts are set aside.

# Anti-Bullying Protections
Ad hominem attacks, character assasination, and other non-factual elements are set aside.

Controlling behavior is not tolerated.  Community members are not permitted to control the relationships and interactions between others.

Definition of Harassment

# Due Process
All accusations must be transparently presented to the accused, and the accused must have an opportunity to tell their sire of the story.

# Relevance

# Identity and Experience
The identify and experience of all parties in the conflict shall be considered.  With respect to an individual's fears, goals, future actions, the individual is the sole posessor of the truth and shall have priority.

# Impact Lens
While intent, identity and experience may be at play, the process shall also take into consideration the impact of one's action on others shall be considered.

# Fairness Proportionality in Consequence
Any conseuqnces or punishment shall be proportionate to the actions and harms caused.

# Restorative
Consequences should be restorative and inclusive in nature.  No vendettas

# Inclusive Shared Spaces
Professional spaces are workplaces where everyone has an inherent right to participate.  When conflicts arise, we aim to resolve those conflicts in an inclusive manner.  We seek to avoid resolving conflicts by inflicting the exclusionary harms we seek to prevent.
No member of the community has the right to exclude or *control* the participation of any other member.

# Identification of the Aggressor
Often in conflicts it can be difficult to determine who the aggressor actually is.  Aggression can be overt or covert and not easily seen.  We will make a it a priority to determine who is attempting to control whom.
